    <h1>On Relationships and Proximity</h1>
    <p>
      Humans are social animals and relationships are a part of our everyday
      life. Here are some points to consider:
      <strong>Relationships are everywhere.</strong>
      We have relationships with friends, colleagues, romantic partners,
      business partners, clients/customers, and even with pets and nature.
    </p>

    <h2>When relationships work: In-phase (resonant)</h2>
    <p>
      When relationships work, they're in-phase, or resonant. This means that
      they're trusting and empathetic towards each other. They have more
      patience and interested in the other's well-being. They work towards to
      greater good. They're harmonious and safe for emotional expression.
      <em>They are coherent, and have a certain degree of order.</em>
    </p>

    <h2>When relationships don't work: Out-of-phase (dysfunctional)</h2>
    <p>
      When relationships are out-of-phase, they're dysfunctional. This means
      that there are trust issues and a lack of patience. Conflict arise more
      often and there is little clear communication. The attitude is egotistic,
      me-first, with little/no interest in the other's well-being. Distance is
      created, leading to disconnection and misalignment.
      <em>They're chaotic and disorderly.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Let's turn to science</h2>
    <p>
      In high school, we learned that oscillators are devices that move in a periodic and repetitive way, between two points of rest.
      Examples include string instruments, radios, pendulum clocks, computers and even the human body. 
      Since our bodies are oscillators, they move and vibrate (vibe-check). These vibes are transmitted to the environment, including all other humans, and animal bodies around us.
      We also learned that as long as we're alive, our bodies generate an electrodynamic field around itself.
      <h3>Proximity and resonance</h3>
      <p>Consider a system of two oscillators, say two well-tuned violins. Did you know that, when in close distance, playing a note on one violin, affects the same string on the other? This process is called <strong>sympathetic resonance</strong>
      What does this tell us? Some kind of energy is transferred within the system, to create a <em>resonant system.</em> Resonance occurs because nature finds it efficient (in energy terms) to have periodic events that are in proximity to occure in-phase with each other.</p>
